# Low-Dropout-Regulator
A Low Dropout Regulator (LDO) is a type of linear voltage regulator that can operate with a very small difference between the input and output voltage, known as the dropout voltage. Unlike switching regulators, LDOs provide a smooth and noise-free output voltage without requiring inductors, making them ideal for low-noise applications.
